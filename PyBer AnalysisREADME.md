# PyBer_Analysis written analysis. 
 
# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
    The Purpose of The Pyber data analysis and visualizations aimed to help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

# Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
    In the PyBer analysis, we were able to determine the mean, median, and mode. The total number of rides for each city type. The average fares for each city type. We created box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the outliers. The number of rides for each city type.The fares for each city type.The number of drivers for each city type. We created a pie chart that visualizes each city type data like percent of total, fares, rides, and drivers. Attached you can find the visualization charts. 
    
       - From the Scatter Chart, we can see that the urban cities have the higher concentration of rides and total fares while the rural have the lowest.

       - From the box and whisker plots, we can see that urban cities have the highest number of rides, followed by Suburban. You can outline that there is an opportunity to    improve rural cities' number of rides.

       - From the Pie Chart that illustrates the total fares by city type, we can determine that 62.7% of the fares come from urban cities, 30.5% from suburban, and 6.8 from rural.

       - The Pie Chart illustrates the total number of rides by city type. We can see that the majority of the rides are coming from urban cities at 68.4%.

       - The Pie Chart illustrates the total number of drivers. We can see that 80.9% of the drivers are in Urban Cities.

       - The line chart illustrates the Total Fares by City Type month over month, showing that behavior for each city.

# Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
     Based on the analysis, we can see that the Rural cities have a lower total number of drivers and rides with a higher average fare price per ride than Suburban and Urban Cities. Based on the data, we recommend increasing the total number of drivers and rides in the rural and suburban cities and reducing pricing to increase the number of rides and revenue. We can offer discounts and promotions to help with overall plan. We are including the PyBer Summary with Total Fares, Total Drivers, and total rides for the city type outlining the avarage fare for ride and driver to help support the recomendation.
